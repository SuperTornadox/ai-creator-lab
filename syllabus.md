## Assessment / 评估方式

This course uses project-based assessment rather than traditional tests:

本课程采用项目制评估而非传统考试：

- **Weekly Projects (70%)**: Each lesson produces creative works. Assessment is based on effort, creativity, and iterative improvement — not perfection.
- **Participation & Discussion (10%)**: Engagement during warm-ups, sharing work, and contributing to discussions (especially during the ethics lesson).
- **Final Project (20%)**: A capstone project combining multiple AI tools, presented in Week 6.

**每周项目（70%）**：每节课产出创意作品。评估基于努力程度、创造力和迭代改进——而非完美程度。
**参与和讨论（10%）**：在热身环节、作品分享和讨论中的参与度（尤其是伦理课程）。
**毕业项目（20%）**：结合多种 AI 工具的综合项目，在第 6 周展示。
