## Pre-Class Preparation / 课前准备

> **Important / 重要:**
> This is the FINAL lesson and the GRADUATION. Make it feel special! Small touches matter enormously --- a printed certificate, a class photo, even a congratulatory note goes a long way for middle schoolers.
>
> **Before class / 课前准备:**
> - Print certificates for each student (or plan to use the digital certificate on the lesson page)
> - Test the lesson page: open `/lesson-12/index.html` and verify all sections work (polish checklist, presentation mode, feedback form, reflection, certificate)
> - Test the slides: open `/lesson-12/slides.html` and click through all 8 slides
> - Optional but recommended: bring a camera or phone for class photos
> - Optional: bring small treats or celebration items (stickers, candy, etc.)
> - Have the timer ready --- this lesson has four distinct phases with tight timing
> - Consider preparing a short "highlights reel" speech noting each student's standout moment from the course
> - Pre-load each student's Lesson 11 workspace to ensure their projects are accessible
>
> **这是最后一课也是毕业典礼。让它感觉特别！小细节对中学生来说意义重大——一张打印的证书、一张合影、甚至一句祝贺的话都很有意义。**
>
> **课前准备：**
> - 为每个学生打印证书（或计划使用课程页面上的电子证书）
> - 测试课程页面：打开 `/lesson-12/index.html`，验证所有部分正常工作（完善清单、展示模式、反馈表、反思、证书）
> - 测试幻灯片：打开 `/lesson-12/slides.html`，点击所有8张幻灯片
> - 可选但推荐：带相机或手机拍合影
> - 可选：带一些小零食或庆祝物品（贴纸、糖果等）
> - 准备好计时器——这节课有四个不同阶段，时间安排紧凑

### [SLIDE 1 --- Title] *(0:00)*

EN: "Welcome to the FINAL lesson of AI Creator Lab! Lesson 12 --- AI Showcase. Today is a very special day. Today, you are going to present your projects to the class, we are going to reflect on everything we have learned together, and then... we graduate. But first, let's make sure your projects are ready to show off."

CN: "欢迎来到 AI 创造者实验室的最后一课！第12课——AI 展示日。今天是非常特别的一天。今天，你们要向全班展示你们的项目，我们会回顾一起学到的所有东西，然后……我们毕业。但首先，让我们确保你们的项目准备好展示了。"

---

### [SLIDE 2 --- Polish Checklist] *(0:01)*

EN: "Open your laptops and go to Lesson 12. You will see a Polish Checklist at the top. Go through each item. Does your project work? Do you have a title? Have you written 'About My Project' and 'My Creative Process'? You have 15 minutes to polish everything and prepare for your presentation."

CN: "打开电脑，进入第12课。你会在顶部看到一个完善清单。逐个检查每一项。你的项目能正常运行吗？你有标题吗？你写了'关于我的项目'和'我的创作过程'吗？你有15分钟来完善一切，准备你的展示。"

EN: "If you already wrote your About and Creative Process sections in Lesson 11, they should already be there --- just review and polish them. If you haven't written them yet, do that NOW. You need these for your presentation."

CN: "如果你在第11课已经写了'关于'和'创作过程'部分，它们应该已经在那里了——检查并完善它们。如果你还没写，现在就写。你展示时需要这些。"

**[Give students 12-13 minutes to polish / 给学生12-13分钟完善]**

**[Walk around and help / 走动并帮助:]**

EN: Check that every student:
- Has their project accessible and working
- Has written their "About My Project" text (at least 2-3 sentences)

### [SLIDE 4 --- Presentation Template] *(0:16)*

EN: "Here is a simple template to help you structure your presentation. You can follow this order: My project is... I made it using... The hardest part was... I learned that... The coolest thing about my project is... You don't have to follow this exactly, but it helps if you're not sure what to say."

CN: "这是一个简单的模板帮助你组织展示。你可以按这个顺序：我的项目是……我用了……来制作它。最难的部分是……我学到了……我的项目最酷的地方是……你不必严格按照这个来，但如果你不确定该说什么，它会有帮助。"

---

### [SLIDE 5 --- It's Showtime!] *(0:17)*

EN: "It's Showtime! We have two presenters today, so each of you will have about 10 minutes --- that's plenty of time. After each presentation, the other person will fill out a peer feedback form on their Lesson 12 page. Are you ready? Who wants to go first?"

CN: "展示时间到！今天有两位展示者，所以你们每人大约有10分钟——时间充裕。每次展示后，另一个人将在第12课页面上填写同伴反馈表。准备好了吗？谁想第一个？"

## Phase 3: Course Reflection / 课程反思 (10 minutes / 分钟)

### [SLIDE 6 --- Our AI Journey] *(0:40)*

EN: "Before we celebrate, let's take a moment to look back at our entire journey. Look at this --- 12 lessons! Lesson 1, we started with AI Words --- just learning to talk to AI. Lesson 2, AI Images. Lesson 3, AI Media --- music and sound. Lesson 4, we started coding with AI. Lesson 5 through 8, we built increasingly amazing things --- websites, animations, chatbots, full apps. Lesson 9, we stopped and thought about ethics --- the responsibility that comes with these powerful tools. Lesson 10, we explored advanced AI tools. Lesson 11, you planned and built your final projects. And today, Lesson 12, you presented them. That is an incredible journey!"

CN: "在庆祝之前，让我们花点时间回顾整个旅程。看这个——12节课！第1课，我们从 AI 文字开始——学习和 AI 对话。第2课，AI 图片。第3课，AI 媒体——音乐和声音。第4课，我们开始用 AI 编程。第5到第8课，我们创建了越来越厉害的东西——网站、动画、聊天机器人、完整的应用。第9课，我们停下来思考伦理——这些强大工具带来的责任。第10课，我们探索了高级 AI 工具。第11课，你们规划并创建了期末项目。今天，第12课，你们展示了它们。这是一段不可思议的旅程！"

EN: "Now, on your Lesson 12 page, scroll down to 'Our AI Journey.' Take 5 minutes to fill in the reflection form. What did you learn? What was your favorite lesson? What's next for you and AI? Be honest and thoughtful --- this is for you."

CN: "现在，在你的第12课页面上，向下滚动到'Our AI Journey'。花5分钟填写反思表。你学到了什么？你最喜欢的课是什么？你和 AI 的下一步是什么？要诚实和深思熟虑——这是写给你自己的。"

**[Give students 5-6 minutes to write reflections / 给学生5-6分钟写反思]**

**[After reflection writing time / 反思写作时间后:]**

EN: "Would anyone like to share what they wrote? What was your favorite lesson and why?"

CN: "有人想分享你写的内容吗？你最喜欢的课是什么，为什么？"

**[Let 1-2 students share briefly / 让1-2个学生简短分享]**

---

### [SLIDE 7 --- What's Next?] *(0:47)*

EN: "So what happens after today? Three things to remember. First: keep creating. You have all these AI tools now --- use them! Make art, write stories, build apps, compose music. Don't let these skills fade. Second: keep learning. AI is changing incredibly fast. New tools come out every month. Stay curious and keep experimenting. And third: stay critical. Remember what we learned about ethics? Always question AI outputs. Think about bias. Use AI responsibly. You are not just AI users --- you are thoughtful AI creators."

CN: "那今天之后会怎样？记住三件事。第一：继续创作。你现在有所有这些 AI 工具——用它们！做艺术、写故事、创建应用、作曲。不要让这些技能消退。第二：继续学习。AI 变化非常快。每个月都有新工具出现。保持好奇，继续实验。第三：保持批判性思维。记得我们学的关于伦理的知识吗？始终质疑 AI 的输出。思考偏见。负责任地使用 AI。你们不只是 AI 用户——你们是有思想的 AI 创造者。"

## Phase 4: Graduation Ceremony / 毕业典礼 (10 minutes / 分钟)

### [SLIDE 8 --- Congratulations!] *(0:50)*

**[Make this moment feel SPECIAL --- this is the big finale / 让这一刻感觉特别——这是盛大的结局]**

EN: "And now... the moment you have been waiting for."

CN: "现在……你们一直等待的时刻。"

**[Pause for dramatic effect / 停顿制造戏剧效果]**

EN: "Congratulations! You are now officially AI Creators!"

CN: "恭喜！你们现在正式成为 AI 创造者了！"

**[Lead enthusiastic applause / 带头热烈鼓掌]**

EN: "Look at the skills you have unlocked. Text AI, Image AI, Music AI, Code AI, Ethics, and Creative Thinking. That is SIX powerful skills. Over these 12 weeks, you have learned something that most adults haven't figured out yet --- how to use AI as a creative partner. And you didn't just learn to USE AI --- you learned to think critically about it, to question it, and to use it responsibly."

CN: "看看你们解锁的技能。文本 AI、图片 AI、音乐 AI、代码 AI、伦理和创造性思维。这是六项强大的技能。在这12周里，你们学到了大多数成年人还没弄明白的东西——如何把 AI 当作创意伙伴。你们不只是学会了使用 AI——你们学会了批判性地思考它、质疑它、负责任地使用它。"

### Final Words *(0:57)*

EN: "I want you to remember one thing from this entire course. Read the message at the bottom of your page."

CN: "我希望你们记住这整门课的一件事。读一下页面底部的信息。"

**[Pause]**

EN: "AI is the tool. YOU are the creator. That is the most important thing. AI can generate text, images, music, code --- but it cannot dream, it cannot imagine, it cannot decide what to create. That part comes from YOU. Your ideas, your creativity, your vision --- those are what make the difference. AI just helps you bring those ideas to life faster."

CN: "AI 是工具。你才是创造者。这是最重要的事情。AI 可以生成文字、图片、音乐、代码——但它不能做梦，不能想象，不能决定创造什么。那部分来自你。你的想法、你的创造力、你的愿景——这些才是关键。AI 只是帮助你更快地把这些想法变为现实。"

EN: "Thank you for being the best class I could ask for. You worked hard, you were creative, and you were brave enough to try new things every week. I am genuinely proud of both of you. Keep creating, keep being curious, and never stop experimenting. The future belongs to creators like you."

CN: "谢谢你们成为我能想到的最好的班级。你们努力学习，充满创意，每周都勇敢地尝试新东西。我真心为你们两个感到骄傲。继续创作，保持好奇，永远不要停止实验。未来属于像你们这样的创造者。"

**[Lead final applause / 带头最后的掌声]**

**[Optional: take a class photo together / 可选：一起拍合影]**

EN: "One last thing --- let's take a class photo together! AI Creators, graduation photo!"

CN: "最后一件事——让我们一起拍个毕业合影！AI 创造者们，毕业照！"

## Contingency Plans / 应急方案

### If polish time runs long / 如果完善时间超时
- Cut it to 10 minutes instead of 15
- Skip the polish checklist and go straight to writing About/Process
- Students can continue polishing during the other student's presentation if needed

### If presentations run long / 如果展示时间超时
- With 2 students you have flexibility --- up to 12-13 minutes each is fine
- If over 30 minutes total on presentations: shorten reflection to 5 minutes (skip the sharing portion, just have them write)
- Move certificate viewing to "homework" --- students can access it at home

### If presentations run short / 如果展示时间不够
- Ask more follow-up questions
- Have the students ask each other questions
- Use extra time for a longer reflection discussion
- Play a "remember when..." game about funny or memorable moments from the course

### If a student's project is not ready / 如果学生的项目没准备好
- "That's completely okay! Walk us through what you planned and what you tried. Show us any piece of it that works, or describe your vision. The process matters as much as the result."
- "完全没关系！给我们讲讲你的计划和你尝试了什么。给我们看任何能用的部分，或者描述你的愿景。过程和结果一样重要。"

### If a student is absent / 如果学生缺席
- The remaining student gets a longer presentation slot (up to 15 minutes)
- Use extra time for a deeper reflection discussion
- The absent student can present in a make-up session or record a video presentation
- Save their certificate for next time you see them

### If the certificate does not show the student's name / 如果证书没显示学生名字
- This happens if the student didn't enter their name at the start. Have them refresh the page --- the name prompt will appear
- Or they can type their name directly into the certificate input if available
- For printed certificates: write the name by hand --- this actually feels MORE special

### If you want to make it extra special / 如果你想让它更特别
- Prepare a short speech highlighting each student's growth and best moment
- Create a "class memories" slide with photos or screenshots from past lessons
- Give each student a small gift (a sticker, bookmark, or printed image they made in class)
- Have students sign each other's certificates
- Email parents a summary of what students accomplished in the course
