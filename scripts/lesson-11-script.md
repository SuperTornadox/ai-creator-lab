## Pre-Class Preparation / 课前准备

> **Important / 重要:**
> This is the capstone lesson --- it combines everything from the entire course into one session. Students will choose their own project type and have freedom to create. Prepare for varying speeds and ambition levels.
>
> **Before class / 课前准备:**
> - Test the lesson page: open `/lesson-06/index.html` and verify all tabs (Text AI, Image AI, Code AI, My Collection) work
> - Verify `/api/chat`, `/api/image`, and `/api/code` endpoints are working
> - Have Suno open in a tab in case students want to add music
> - Optional but highly recommended: prepare simple certificates (paper or digital) with each student's name. Even a printed sheet that says "AI Creator Lab Graduate" with a blank line for the name goes a long way
> - Consider preparing a 1-minute example of a finished simple project to show as inspiration (e.g., a 3-page magazine with AI text + images)
> - Have a timer visible for the class --- this lesson has tight timing
>
> **这是总结课——把整个课程的内容综合到一节课中。学生将选择自己的项目类型并自由创作。准备好应对不同的速度和野心水平。**
>
> **课前准备：**
> - 测试课程页面：打开 `/lesson-06/index.html`，验证所有标签（文本 AI、图片 AI、代码 AI、我的收藏）正常工作
> - 验证 `/api/chat`、`/api/image` 和 `/api/code` 接口正常工作
> - 打开 Suno 标签页以备学生需要添加音乐
> - 可选但强烈推荐：准备简单的证书（纸质或电子），写上每个学生的名字。即使只是一张写着"AI Creator Lab Graduate"留有名字空白的打印纸也很有意义
> - 考虑准备一个1分钟的简单完成项目示例作为灵感（例如：一本3页的杂志，包含 AI 文本和图片）
> - 准备一个对全班可见的计时器——这节课时间安排很紧

## Warm-up & Planning / 热身与规划 (8 minutes / 分钟)

### [SLIDE 1 --- Title] *(0:00)*

EN: "Welcome to our FINAL lesson in AI Creator Lab! Today is special --- today is your graduation day. You are going to plan, build, and present your own creative project using everything you have learned. And at the end, we celebrate --- because you are all about to become official AI Creators!"

CN: "欢迎来到 AI 创造者实验室的最后一课！今天很特别——今天是你们的毕业日。你们要规划、创建和展示你们自己的创意项目，用上你们学到的所有东西。最后我们会庆祝——因为你们都将成为正式的 AI 创造者！"

---

### [SLIDE 2 --- Look How Far You've Come] *(0:01)*

EN: "Let's take a moment to look back. Six weeks ago, most of you had never used AI to create anything. Now look at your skills --- you can make AI write stories, generate images, compose music. That is incredible progress."

CN: "让我们花一点时间回顾一下。六周前，你们大多数人从没用 AI 创造过任何东西。现在看看你们的技能——你们能让 AI 写故事、生成图片、创作音乐。这是不可思议的进步。"

---

### [SLIDE 3 --- Skills Unlocked] *(0:02)*

EN: "Here are all the skills you have unlocked. Text AI --- you can write stories, articles, lyrics, scripts. Image AI --- you can create illustrations, scenes, characters. Music AI --- you can compose songs and soundtracks. Film making --- you can combine everything into a mini film. Code AI --- you can write and run code with AI help. And AI ethics --- you understand how to use AI responsibly. That is six powerful skills!"

CN: "这是你们解锁的所有技能。文本 AI——你们能写故事、文章、歌词、剧本。图片 AI——你们能创建插画、场景、角色。音乐 AI——你们能作曲和配乐。电影制作——你们能把所有东西组合成迷你电影。代码 AI——你们能在 AI 帮助下编写和运行代码。还有 AI 伦理——你们理解如何负责任地使用 AI。这是六项强大的技能！"

---

### [SLIDE 4 --- Project Options] *(0:03)*

EN: "For your final project, you get to CHOOSE what you want to make. Here are four options. Option 1: AI Magazine --- write articles and create illustrations, like a real magazine. Option 2: AI Short Film --- write a story, generate scene images, add music. You already know how to do this from Lesson 5! Option 3: AI Game --- design and code a simple game with AI help. Option 4: Free Choice --- your own creative idea using any combination of AI tools. Pick the one that excites you the most!"

CN: "期末项目，你们可以选择自己想做什么。这里有四个选项。选项1：AI 杂志——写文章和创建插画，像真正的杂志一样。选项2：AI 短片——写故事、生成场景图片、添加音乐。你们在第5课已经学会了！选项3：AI 游戏——在 AI 帮助下设计和编写一个简单的游戏。选项4：自由选择——用任何 AI 工具组合的你自己的创意想法。选你最兴奋的那个！"

---

### [SLIDE 5 --- Planning Tips] *(0:04)*

EN: "Before you start building, here are some important tips. First, start small. A finished small project is MUCH better than an unfinished big one. You only have 35 minutes to build, so keep your scope manageable. Second, use what you know. Pick tools you are comfortable with --- do not try to learn something brand new today. Third, make it personal. Choose a topic you actually care about --- your project will be better when you are excited about it. And fourth, write a plan. Take 3 minutes right now to plan before you build."

CN: "在开始创建之前，这里有一些重要提示。第一，从小处开始。一个完成的小项目比一个未完成的大项目好得多。你只有35分钟来创建，所以保持范围可控。第二，用你知道的。选你熟悉的工具——今天不要试着学全新的东西。第三，做个人化的。选一个你真正关心的主题——当你对它感到兴奋时，项目会更好。第四，写个计划。现在花3分钟在创建之前先做计划。"

EN: "Open your laptops now and go to Lesson 6. Start by choosing your project type --- click on one of the four cards. Then fill in the planning form: your project title, a description, which tools you will use, and 3 to 5 steps for your plan. Click 'Save My Plan' when you are done."

CN: "现在打开电脑，进入第六课。首先选择你的项目类型——点击四张卡片中的一张。然后填写规划表：项目标题、描述、你会使用哪些工具，以及你计划的3到5个步骤。完成后点击'Save My Plan'。"

**[Give students 3-4 minutes to choose and plan / 给学生 3-4 分钟选择和规划]**

> **Contingency / 应对方案:**
> EN: If a student cannot decide: "Pick the one that sounds the most fun to YOU. If you still cannot decide, go with AI Magazine --- it is the most flexible and you can include anything."
> CN: 如果学生无法决定："选一个对你来说听起来最有趣的。如果还是无法决定，就选 AI 杂志——它最灵活，你可以包含任何东西。"

> **Contingency / 应对方案:**
> EN: If a student wants to do something not in the four options: "Absolutely! Click 'Free Choice' and describe your idea in the plan. As long as you use at least two AI tools, anything goes."
> CN: 如果学生想做四个选项以外的东西："当然可以！点击'Free Choice'并在计划中描述你的想法。只要你使用至少两个 AI 工具，什么都行。"

---

### [SLIDE 6 --- Building Time] *(0:06)*

EN: "Plans ready? Great! Now it is building time. You have 35 minutes. The workspace has four tabs: Text AI for writing and brainstorming, Image AI for creating pictures, Code AI for writing code, and My Collection to see all your generated images in one place. There is also a Project Notes area at the bottom --- use it to keep track of your ideas and progress."

CN: "计划准备好了？太好了！现在是创建时间。你有35分钟。工作区有四个标签：文本 AI 用于写作和头脑风暴，图片 AI 用于创建图片，代码 AI 用于编写代码，还有我的收藏可以在一个地方看到所有生成的图片。底部还有项目笔记区域——用它来记录你的想法和进度。"

EN: "Go! Start creating!"

CN: "开始！开始创作！"

## Build Phase / 创建阶段 (35 minutes / 分钟)

### Active Building (first 20 min) *(0:08--0:28)*

**[Switch from slides to monitoring student screens / 从幻灯片切换到巡视学生屏幕]**

**[Walk around continuously / 持续走动巡视:]**

EN: Check that every student has:
- Selected a project type
- Saved their plan
- Started creating content in at least one tab

Help students who are stuck. Common issues:
- "I do not know what to write" --- help them brainstorm with the Text AI chat
- "The image does not look right" --- help them refine their prompt
- "The code does not work" --- help them describe the bug to the Code AI

CN: 检查每个学生是否：
- 选择了项目类型
- 保存了计划
- 在至少一个标签中开始创建内容

帮助卡住的学生。常见问题：
- "我不知道写什么"——帮他们用文本 AI 聊天头脑风暴
- "图片看起来不对"——帮他们优化提示词
- "代码不工作"——帮他们向代码 AI 描述 bug

> **Contingency / 应对方案:**
> EN: If API services are slow: "While waiting for a response, switch to another tab and work on a different part of your project. Multitask!"
> CN: 如果 API 服务很慢："等待回应的时候，切换到另一个标签，做项目的其他部分。多任务并行！"

---

### [SLIDE 7 --- Mid-Build Checkpoint] *(0:28)*

**[Show slide 7 briefly / 短暂展示幻灯片7]**

EN: "Quick checkpoint, everyone! We are about halfway through building time. Look at your project and ask yourself: Do I have a clear idea? Have I started creating content? What do I still need to finish? You have about 15 more minutes. If you have been spending a lot of time on one thing, it might be time to move on to the next step. Focus on getting something DONE rather than making everything perfect."

CN: "快速检查点，大家！我们建设时间差不多过半了。看看你的项目，问问自己：我有明确的想法吗？我开始创建内容了吗？我还需要完成什么？你还有大约15分钟。如果你一直在一件事上花很多时间，可能是时候进入下一步了。专注于完成一些东西，而不是让所有东西都完美。"

**[Switch back to monitoring / 切换回巡视]**

---

### Final Building + Presentation Prep (15 min) *(0:28--0:43)*

EN: At the 35-minute mark (0:35 from start), give a 8-minute warning:

EN: "Eight minutes left for building! If you have not started on your presentation section yet, scroll down now and start filling in 'About My Project' and 'My Creative Process.' You need these for your presentation."

CN: "还剩8分钟创建时间！如果你还没开始写展示部分，现在向下滚动，开始填写'About My Project'和'My Creative Process'。你展示时需要这些。"

EN: At the 40-minute mark (0:40), give a 3-minute warning:

EN: "Three minutes! Finish up what you are working on and make sure your presentation text is written. You do not need to be 100% done with the project --- just have something you are proud to show."

CN: "3分钟！完成你正在做的，确保展示文字已经写好。你不需要100%完成项目——只需要有你自豪展示的东西。"

---

## Present & Celebrate / 展示与庆祝 (15 minutes / 分钟)

### [SLIDE 8 --- Presentation Tips] *(0:43)*

EN: "Building time is over! Now comes the fun part --- you get to show off what you made. Here are some quick tips for your presentation. Show your work --- actually demo your project, do not just talk about it. Explain your process --- tell us HOW you made it, what tools you used. Share a challenge --- what was hard? How did you solve it? And most importantly, be proud! You made something amazing with AI."

CN: "创建时间结束！现在是有趣的部分——你们要展示你们做的东西。这里有一些展示的快速提示。展示你的作品——实际演示你的项目，不要只是口头说。解释你的过程——告诉我们你怎么做的，用了什么工具。分享一个挑战——什么是困难的？你怎么解决的？最重要的是，要自豪！你用 AI 做了一些了不起的东西。"

EN: "You can use the 'Launch Presentation Mode' button on your page to show a clean fullscreen version. Or just show your workspace directly --- either is fine."

CN: "你可以用页面上的'Launch Presentation Mode'按钮展示一个干净的全屏版本。或者直接展示你的工作区——都可以。"

---

### Student Presentations *(0:44--0:56)*

EN: "Who wants to go first? Come up and show us your project!"

CN: "谁想第一个？上来给我们展示你的项目！"

**[Each student gets approximately 5-7 minutes depending on class size / 每个学生根据班级大小大约有5-7分钟]**

**For each presenter / 对每个展示者：**

1. Ask them to introduce their project: "Tell us what you made and why you chose this project."
   "告诉我们你做了什么以及为什么选择这个项目。"

2. Have them demo / show their work (either presentation mode or workspace)
   让他们演示/展示作品（展示模式或工作区）

3. Ask one follow-up question:
   - "What was the hardest part?" / "最难的部分是什么？"
   - "What AI tool was the most useful for your project?" / "哪个 AI 工具对你的项目最有用？"
   - "If you had more time, what would you add?" / "如果你有更多时间，你会添加什么？"

4. Lead applause after each presentation / 每次展示后带头鼓掌

> **Contingency / 应对方案:**
> EN: If you have more than 3 students and time is tight: Have each student present for 3-4 minutes maximum. Skip the follow-up question if needed. The important thing is that EVERY student gets to show something.
> CN: 如果有超过3个学生且时间紧张：每个学生最多展示3-4分钟。必要时跳过追问。重要的是每个学生都能展示一些东西。

> **Contingency / 应对方案:**
> EN: If a student is shy or their project is not finished: "That is totally fine! Show us one thing you made that you are proud of --- even if it is just one image or one paragraph. Every creator starts somewhere."
> CN: 如果学生害羞或项目没完成："完全没关系！给我们看一样你自豪的东西——即使只是一张图片或一段文字。每个创作者都是从某个起点开始的。"

---

### [SLIDE 9 --- Course Recap] *(0:56)*

EN: "Before we wrap up, let's take one last look at everything we have done together. Lesson 1, we learned to chat with AI and write stories. Lesson 2, we went deeper into storytelling and picture books. Lesson 3, we created amazing images. Lesson 4, we composed music. Lesson 5, we directed mini films. And today, Lesson 6, you combined everything into your own unique project. What a journey!"

CN: "在结束之前，让我们最后回顾一下我们一起做的所有事情。第1课，我们学会了和 AI 聊天和写故事。第2课，我们深入了讲故事和绘本。第3课，我们创造了惊人的图片。第4课，我们作了曲。第5课，我们导演了迷你电影。今天，第6课，你们把所有东西组合成了你们自己独特的项目。多么精彩的旅程！"

EN: "Congratulations! You are now officially AI Creators!"

CN: "恭喜！你们现在正式成为 AI 创造者了！"

**[Lead applause / 带头鼓掌]**

EN: "Over these six weeks, you have learned something that most adults have not figured out yet --- how to use AI as a creative partner. You learned to write with AI, create art, compose music, make films, and code. And today you proved that you can combine all of those skills into something uniquely yours."

CN: "在这六周里，你们学到了大多数成年人还没弄明白的东西——如何把 AI 当作创意伙伴。你们学会了用 AI 写作、创作艺术、作曲、制作电影和编程。今天你们证明了你们可以把所有这些技能组合成独特属于你们自己的东西。"

EN: "Here is what I want you to remember: AI is a tool. A very powerful tool. But the creativity, the ideas, the vision --- that comes from YOU. Never stop creating. Never stop being curious. And never stop experimenting. The future belongs to creators like you."

CN: "我想让你们记住的是：AI 是一个工具。一个非常强大的工具。但创造力、想法、愿景——都来自你们。永远不要停止创作。永远不要停止好奇。永远不要停止实验。未来属于像你们这样的创造者。"

## Contingency Plans / 应急方案

### If build time runs long / 如果创建时间超时
- Cut the mid-build checkpoint (skip Slide 7)
- Reduce presentation time to 3 minutes per student
- Move graduation celebration to be faster (1 minute)

### If presentations run short / 如果展示时间不够
- Have students present in pairs --- they can interview each other about their projects
- Keep presentations to 2-3 minutes each and use remaining time for a class discussion about the whole course

### If a student's project did not work / 如果学生的项目没有成功
- "That is part of the creative process! Tell us what you TRIED to make and what you learned. Even professional creators face failures --- it is how we learn."
- "这是创作过程的一部分！告诉我们你试图做什么以及你学到了什么。即使专业创作者也会面临失败——这是我们学习的方式。"

### If APIs are down / 如果 API 宕机
- Have students plan their projects on paper first (detailed written plan)
- Use the Text AI chat for brainstorming even if image generation is slow
- Students can describe their intended images in writing as part of their presentation
- Focus more on the planning and presentation aspects of the lesson

### Certificate suggestions / 证书建议
- Simple option: Print a sheet with "AI Creator Lab --- Certificate of Completion" and the student's name, with a list of skills learned
- Digital option: Create a simple HTML page certificate and share via USB or email
- Fun option: Have students design their own certificates using Image AI during build time
