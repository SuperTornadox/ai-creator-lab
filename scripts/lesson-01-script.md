## Warm-up / 概念热身 (10 minutes / 分钟)

### [SLIDE 1 — Title]

EN: "Welcome to AI Creator Lab! Over the next 12 weeks, you're going to learn how to create amazing things using artificial intelligence. But first — let's find out what you already know about AI."

CN: "欢迎来到 AI 创造者实验室！在接下来的 12 周里，你们将学会如何用人工智能创造很棒的东西。但首先——让我们看看你们对 AI 已经了解多少。"

---

### [SLIDE 2 — What do you think AI is?]

EN: "So, what do you think AI is? Just say whatever comes to mind — there's no wrong answer."

CN: "那你们觉得 AI 是什么？想到什么就说什么——没有错误的答案。"

**[Wait for student responses / 等待学生回答]**

> 💡 **Teacher tip / 教师提示:**
> EN: Most students will mention robots or Siri. Accept all answers warmly. If they're shy, prompt with: "Have you heard the word AI before? Where?"
> CN: 大多数学生会提到机器人或 Siri。热情地接受所有回答。如果他们害羞，可以提示："你们之前听说过 AI 这个词吗？在哪里听到的？"

EN: "Great answers! Let me show you something..."

CN: "回答得很好！让我给你们看点东西……"

---

### [SLIDE 3 — AI Is Already In Your Life]

EN: "AI is already part of your everyday life — you just might not realize it."

CN: "AI 已经是你们日常生活的一部分了——只是你们可能没意识到。"

EN: "When you talk to Siri or Alexa — that's AI listening and understanding your voice."

CN: "当你跟 Siri 或 Alexa 说话时——那就是 AI 在听和理解你的声音。"

EN: "When YouTube or TikTok recommends videos you like — that's AI learning your taste."

CN: "当 YouTube 或 TikTok 给你推荐你喜欢的视频时——那是 AI 在学习你的喜好。"

EN: "When you unlock your phone with your face — that's AI recognizing you."

CN: "当你用脸解锁手机时——那是 AI 在识别你。"

EN: "So AI isn't some far-away future thing. It's already right here."

CN: "所以 AI 不是什么遥远的未来事物。它已经就在这里了。"

---

### [SLIDE 4 — What AI is NOT]

EN: "But there are a lot of myths about AI. Let's clear some up."

CN: "但是关于 AI 有很多误解。让我们澄清一下。"

EN: "AI is not a brain. It doesn't think the way you and I think."

CN: "AI 不是大脑。它不像你我这样思考。"

EN: "It's not alive. It doesn't have feelings or experiences."

CN: "它不是活的。它没有感受或体验。"

EN: "It's not magic — it runs on math and data."

CN: "它不是魔法——它靠数学和数据运行。"

EN: "And very importantly: it's not always right. AI can make mistakes — sometimes big ones!"

CN: "而且非常重要的是：它并不总是对的。AI 会犯错——有时候是大错！"

---

### [SLIDE 5 — What AI IS]

EN: "So what IS AI, really? At its core, AI is a computer program that learns patterns from lots and lots of data."

CN: "那 AI 到底是什么呢？本质上，AI 是一个从大量数据中学习规律的计算机程序。"

EN: "Here's a way to think about it: Imagine a student who read every single book in the library. Every novel, every textbook, every comic book. They can talk about almost anything — but they never actually experienced any of it. They're just really, really good at remembering and combining what they read."

CN: "这样来想：想象一个学生读了图书馆里每一本书。每本小说、每本教材、每本漫画书。他们几乎什么都能聊——但他们从来没有真正经历过。他们只是非常非常擅长记住和组合他们读过的东西。"

EN: "That's kind of what AI does. It learned from billions of pieces of text, and now it can generate new text that sounds smart and creative."

CN: "这有点像 AI 做的事情。它从数十亿条文本中学习，现在它可以生成听起来聪明又有创意的新文本。"

---

### [SLIDE 6 — Let's Ask AI Something Weird!]

EN: "Okay, let's try something fun. I'm going to ask AI a really weird question and let's see what happens."

CN: "好，让我们来试点有趣的。我要问 AI 一个很奇怪的问题，看看会发生什么。"

**[Open ChatGPT or the course chat page and type the question live / 打开 ChatGPT 或课程聊天页面，现场输入问题]**

EN: "Let's ask: 'What would happen if cats could send emails?'"

CN: "我们来问：'如果猫会发邮件会怎样？'"

**[Read the AI response aloud / 大声读出 AI 的回答]**

EN: "Ha! Did you hear that? That was pretty creative, right? But here's the important question..."

CN: "哈！你们听到了吗？挺有创意的对吧？但重要的问题来了……"

---

### [SLIDE 7 — How did AI come up with that?]

EN: "How did AI come up with that answer? Did it really know what would happen if cats could email?"

CN: "AI 是怎么想出那个答案的？它真的知道如果猫会发邮件会怎样吗？"

**[Pause for student responses / 暂停等待学生回答]**

EN: "Right! It didn't really 'know.' It read tons of things about cats and tons of things about emails, and it combined them into something that sounds like a great answer."

CN: "对！它并不真的'知道'。它读了大量关于猫的内容和大量关于邮件的内容，然后把它们组合成了一个听起来很棒的答案。"

EN: "That's the secret of AI: it's amazing at creating things that sound good. And today, you're going to have a conversation with it yourself."

CN: "这就是 AI 的秘密：它非常擅长创造听起来很好的东西。今天，你们自己要跟它对话。"

### [SLIDE 8 — Today's Mission]

EN: "Here's your mission for today. You are a REPORTER. Your job is to interview an AI character — ask it questions, find out interesting things about it, and maybe even discover something funny."

CN: "这是你们今天的任务。你是一名记者。你的工作是采访一个 AI 角色——问它问题，发现有趣的事情，也许还能发现一些好笑的东西。"

EN: "You'll get to pick one of these six characters to interview."

CN: "你可以从这六个角色中选一个来采访。"

CN: "有一只觉得自己是你老板的会说话的猫……一个来自 3000 年的时间旅行者……一个刚到地球的友好外星人……一个只做甜品的厨师……一个想休假的超级英雄……还有最后一只幸存的恐龙。"

EN: "Each one has a totally different personality. Pick the one that sounds most fun to you!"

**[Wait for responses / 等待回答]**
